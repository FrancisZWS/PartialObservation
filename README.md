# Collaborative Learning Based Spectrum Sensing Under Partial Observations
## Introduction
This project is a distributed learning method based on decoupled heterogeneous CNNs to collaboratively learn and detect the wideband occuancy of a wireless environment. The baselines include standalone learning, federated learning, and energy detection, which are also implemented.
